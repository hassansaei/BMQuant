## BMQuant
The basement membrane quant (BMQuant) is a FIJI macro and a framework for basement membrane protein quantification in organoid models. 

---

This macro takes raw data in .czi format, regeans of interest (ROIs), and ilastk project file as input.
We can assign the thickness of the border indicating the basement membranes in our objects (glomeruli or tubule). 
It calculates border area and mean fluorscent intensity of the channel of interest and generate a csv file with the values for each object.

** As we have developed an X-linked Alport syndrome kidney organoid model, we aimed to develope a Fiji macro to make the basement membrane quantifications faster and automatic.
